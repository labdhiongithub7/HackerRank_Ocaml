#This repository is dedicated to storing my HackerRank submissions, where I am actively practicing and improving my skills in the OCaml programming language. It includes solutions to various algorithmic problems, data structures, and challenges I encounter while learning OCaml. This repository serves as a collection of my learning progress and will help me track the problems Iâ€™ve solved and the solutions I've implemented, as I continue to deepen my understanding of OCaml and its applications.
